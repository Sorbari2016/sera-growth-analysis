## Data Transformation in SQL 
- I carried out some important data transformations on the sera subscription dataset that was made availabe, using PostgreSQL.
- Creating a datetime field using the transaction_date, another field for card_type_group where card types can only be verve, visa, or mastercard using the card_type field. 
- I created one more field called credit_or_debit which indicates whether the card created was either debit or credit,  also from the card_type field.
- I finally tied all the transformations together, by selecting the fields I needed for analysis, which  also included both the transformed field, to create a view.
